# All versions of NST package
- Version 3.1.8: add summary and test for SES and RC in functions tNST, pNST, cNST, nst.boot, and nst.panova.
- Version 3.1.7: revise function nst.panova to avoid error for special cases in permutation.
- Version 3.1.6: revise functions tNST, pNST, cNST, nst.boot, and nst.panova to avoid error for special cases in MST calculation.
- Version 3.1.5: add function cNST to calculate NST using user customized beta diversity and the null results.
- Version 3.1.4: debug ab.assign.
- Version 3.1.3: add options to specify occurrence frequency in regional pool.
- Version 3.1.2: provide temporary solution for the failure of makeCluster in some OS.
- Version 3.1.1: add options to allow input propotional data (rather than counts) as community matrix, as well as community data transformation before dissimilarity calculation.
- Version 3.0.6: 2021.1.7, update references.
- Version 3.0.5: 2020.12.2, debug nst.panova.
- Version 3.0.4: 2020.9.20, update github link of NST; update nst.boot and nst.panova to include MST results.
- Version 3.0.3: 2020.9.9, submit to CRAN. remove setwd in functions; change dontrun to donttest and revise save.wd in help doc.
- Version 3.0.2: 2020.8.31, debug pNST.
- Version 3.0.1: 2020.8.23, Add NST based on phylogenetic beta diversity (pNST).
- Version 2.0.4: 2019.10.8, submit to CRAN. Update citation and references. Emphasize that NST variation should be calculated from nst.boot rather than pairwise NST.ij from tNST. Emphasize that different group setting in tNST may lead to different NST results.
- Version 2.0.3: 2019.6.14, submit to CRAN.
- Version 2.0.2: 2019.6.14
